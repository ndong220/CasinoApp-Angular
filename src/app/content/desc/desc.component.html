          Choosing a good online casino which meets all your requirements is not
          as easy as it sounds. To make your life easier we have created a short
          list of criteria you should always consider:

          <li>The casino accepts players from your country</li>
          <li>
            Good casino reputation (evaluated by our casino review team - pick
            casinos with GOOD and PERFECT ratings)
          </li>
          <li>License from a respected regulator</li>
          <li>
            Reasonably high revenues compared to your highest possible wins
          </li>

            wins)
          </li>
          <li>
            A selection of your favorite games (use the Game Provider filter on
            the right)

            Customer support and website localized in your native language

          Soon after we started Casino.Guru as a project, we realized that we
          needed to rate online casinos based on objective criteria. Trying the
          casino on our own isn't enough to get a representative experience, and
          we would have to win huge amounts in every casino we reviewed to prove
          that they pay out on big winnings. That is just not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why our reviews are based on the experience of other players,
          sourced from rigorous research of various forums, mediation websites
          and other sources. It's not an easy task to judge who was right in the
          case of complaints which remain unresolved. But in the end, we usually
          get an impression of how the casino treats its players.
        </p>
        <p>My basic formula for the casino reputation rating considers the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Number of complaints where we think the casino wasn't acting fair
          </li>
          <li>Amount of money involved in these cases</li>
          <li>
            Number of casino visitors, its estimated revenues and how long the
            casino operates
          </li>

          Yes, it does. For casinos with a long track record it can take up to
          20 hours. Our independent casino review team members read everything
          they are able to find on the internet. They read all forums, mediation
          websites or reviews posted by real users.

          The list of casinos you can see here is our best guess for casinos
          which may suit your needs and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, we intentionally omit casinos which don't accept players
          from your country. It makes no sense to point you to them, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we display casinos which we know are a great fit for a
          certain country in the top positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, we prefer casinos which are localized to your native language
          or offer customer support in that language. Communication in a native
          language is, for many players, a more comfortable experience, and if a
          casino is localized, it will more likely understand the specific needs
          of players from your country.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the localization ranking is already mixed with the reputation
          ranking. So we display higher non-localized casinos with PERFECT
          reputation over localized casinos with a BAD track-record.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that, we use various other minor ranking criteria. But
          ultimately, if you want to find the best casino for you as quickly as
          possible, the easiest way is to use the filters on the right and
          filter the casinos based on your own criteria.

          We put a lot of effort into having our casino database up to date,
          including the countries from which each casino accepts players. That
          said, there are also websites specialized in individual countries, on
          which you can find country-specific lists of casinos. You can find
          some of them below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>United Kingdom</strong><br />Players from the United Kingdom
          can choose from a big number of great casinos, with one of the best
          gambling licensing authorities (UK Gambling Commission) governs all
          gambling activities in the country. You can check out our list of UK
          online casinos, or dedicated websites like kingcasinobonus.co.uk which
          specializes in casino bonuses for UK players, but also has a list of
          best casinos for players from the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Italy</strong><br />Gambling in Italy is legal and regulated
          from 2011, when a new gambling law has been introduced. Italian
          players can browse online casinos and casino bonuses right here on
          Casino Guru, either in English, or by visiting the version of our
          website localised for the Italian market available at
          casinoguru-it.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Greece</strong><br />The Greek gambling market is strongly
          influenced by the country's intention to keep the state-run OPAP a
          monopoly, which, however, violates EU laws. Greece's gambling laws are
          being amended and it's expected that other online casinos will be able
          to get official Greek licenses again. Greek players can find relevant
          online casinos on gr.casino.guru.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Czech Republic</strong><br />Czech Republic has introduced a
          new Gambling Act back in 2017, which governs all online gambling
          operators who wish to legally target Czech players. Players from Czech
          Republic can find relevant online casinos on the Czech version on
          Casino Guru available at kasinoguru-cz.com.
